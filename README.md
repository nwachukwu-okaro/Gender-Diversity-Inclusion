# HR Diversity and Inclusion Analysis - Power BI Project
This project explores the HR database of a company to analyze gender diversity and inclusion across various aspects including recruitment, pay, performance rating, location, and departments. The analysis is conducted using Power BI and the findings are presented through visualizations and insights.

# Dataset
The project consists of two datasets:

Bonus_Rate Dataset: This dataset contains information about the performance rating structure and the corresponding performance bonus percentage for each rating. It also includes data for the 12 departments within the company.

Employee Dataset: This dataset contains 873 rows and 11 columns, providing information about various employees in the company. The columns include employee details such as name, gender, department, location, pay, and performance rating.

# Analysis Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

1.Analyzing gender diversity in recruitment: Understanding the representation of genders in the recruitment process and identifying any   disparities or trends.

2. Exploring pay disparities: Analyzing the gender pay gap within the company and identifying areas where adjustments may be necessary.

3. Evaluating performance rating distribution: Assessing the distribution of performance ratings across genders and determining if any biases exist.

4. Investigating departmental diversity: Analyzing the gender composition within different departments to identify areas for improvement in terms of inclusivity and representation.

5. Assessing location-based diversity: Exploring the geographical distribution of employees and evaluating gender diversity across different locations.

# Power BI Analysis and Reporting
The analysis and visualization of the HR database were conducted using Power BI. Power BI allows for comprehensive data exploration, visualizations, and insights. The resulting reports and dashboards provide a clear and concise overview of the findings.

# Exported Results
The analysis results have been exported as a PDF document for easy sharing and accessibility. The PDF document provides an overview of the project objectives, key insights, visualizations, and recommendations for improving gender diversity and inclusion within the company.

# Caveats
1. Some of the operations like using the department and locations drop downs cannot be used in this pdf format.
2. Due to data privacy concerns the dataset cannot be made public.
